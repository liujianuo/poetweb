              Gray smog, what fills the sky with hazy blight. <br>
              Surround our town with barren dust-filled silt. <br>
              A screen, desires kept from godly sight <br>
              Lest He condemn the devil's lair we've built. <br>
               <br>
              Make haste, create our patched seal of ash. <br>
              Conceal our sin from nature's loving arms. <br>
              The grovelling men who murder unabashed <br>
              The life we lived before without alarm. <br>
               <br>
              The dream we had, pursued in primal state, <br>
              Has given way for greed and lust unchecked. <br>
              Yet hurry not away from human fate, <br>
              But revel in the wrongs we did create. <br>
               <br>
              The ruin of our deeds in world's decay <br>
              Shall never see the open light of day. <br>

              Silence is the sacred music of gods, <br>
              Not love as some before me have described. <br>
              Some find themselves eternally at odds <br>
              To find but just a love that felt contrived. <br>
              <br>
              Mortal muses may shriek in their shrill groans, <br>
              Bleed the deaf 'till they have been forsaken. <br>
              Compare them not to ethereal tones <br>
              In heavenly chords, cadence unbroken. <br>
              <br>
              Silent loyalty is the sacred pact <br>
              That holds sinners in just and moral right. <br>
              And although love gives us excited act, <br>
              It's the hidden that leads us to the light. <br>
              <br>
              Love may plague and prick the lost and broken, <br>
              Held from secrets found in the unspoken. <br>

              Love is not the sudden flutter of hearts,<br>
              Nor the locked eyes of strangers across halls.<br>
              Not extravagant displays of fine art,<br>
              And not intimacy heard through the walls. <br>
              <br>
              Love is not attraction between lovers,<br>
              But the dedication and sacraftice.<br>
              Adoration is but under cover,<br>
              The vows you made, which carry you through strife.<br>
              <br>
              So be not amused by the heart's folly<br>
              And little muses, but rather grounded.<br>
              Find love in the budding water lillies<br>
              and cherish the time you've been allotted.<br>
              <br>
              Love is the vow to stay 'till the last breath.<br>
              Never apart, in this world or the next.<br>

                Wilted flowers are just as beautiful <br>
                As ones picked fresh from the morning garden.<br>
                Winter's harvest may be just as bountiful<br>
                When blizzard's chill have the frost roots harden<br>
                <br>
                Broken beauty may be just as cherished,<br>
                Held as dearly as Providence's gift.<br>
                And imperfection hold equal merit<br>
                As flawless bow strokes, lines at perfect lift.<br>
                <br>
                There's a different beauty I hold in hope,<br>
                One which common man and art abandoned.<br>
                Taken away for plastic, I must cope<br>
                And wish that days would take on this vision.<br>
                <br>
                Wilted flowers are just as beautiful,<br>
                While man's obsession with it, unfaithful.<br>

                How do I explain to you quite gently<br>
                The unfortunate mishaps in the world.<br>
                How do I show to you the sentiment<br>
                Of asymptotes, never to reach the goal.<br>
                <br>
                How do I demonstrate the attraction<br>
                Of opposites, set apart in space.<br>
                Even all the little abberation<br>
                That set coincidental paths away.<br>
                <br>
                How do I demonstrate the affection<br>
                Needed to bring impossibles so close.<br>
                The affinity of life's direction<br>
                To bring together those who were once foes.<br>
                <br>
                Must I demonstrate to you the feeling:<br>
                Knowing the impossible, yet dreaming?<br>

                Dwell not on the promises that were made,<br>
                And mope, stay stagnant, hung up on the past.<br>
                Dwell not on what the words were that she said.<br>
                But look anew, true love would always last.<br>
                <br>
                What you started will never be finished,<br>
                So why believe in the impossible?<br>
                What you pledged will never be completed, <br>
                So do not chase what will never be yours.<br>
                <br>
                What once was may never return again,<br>
                When winter's barren breeze freeze it over.<br>
                Time and experience may leave like sand,<br>
                Slipping through the cracks in desert's expanse.<br>
                <br>
                Yet dwell not on abandoned promises,<br>
                And be left behind as time progresses.<br>
