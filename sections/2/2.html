                I like to think that in the quadrillions of words that man has written, that <br>
                Love is the most potent, its simple yet inexplicably intricate nature being the<br>
                One greatest folly, and yet also the one greatest joy of man. In peace and <br>
                Violence, both the same, it plays its part as the puppetmaster, acting its<br>
                Ethereal play, us adherents, its dolls, playing the tragic roles of its <br>
                Youthful and sadistic imagination. <br>
                Of how it decides upon its targets, I know naught, yet its pounding,<br>
                Unadulterated vigour, which fills my heart, nerve, and sinew, with<br>
                Vivacious might that rivals the light of day, brings my mind to sing <br>
                In ways previously unknown. <br>
                Vivid images fill my thoughts with possibilities the world beholds, yet<br>
                In each of them the same brilliant pair of eyes alight seem to see these same<br>
                Absurd fantasies as the reality of the future. All I ask is that this <br>
                Nurturing pair of eyes are yours.<br>

                Gone are the days of blue skies and birds chirping <br>
                On the branch of the arbutus, standing high and tall <br>
                Over the newly sprouted dandelion and weed, <br>
                Decorating the field, which blends into the <br>
                Natural, rolling hills that meet the sky <br>
                In a kaleidescope of intersections. <br>
                Gone is the pounding summer sun and the <br>
                Heat (oh how it raged) that drove even <br>
                The most resilient of us into insomnia in the night. <br>
                Bearing the harvest's full wreath of pastoral wealth, <br>
                In great regret, Father Time passes us by. <br>
                Gone is Gaia's loving glow in the harsh frigid cold, leaving <br>
                Behind only ourselves to keep company and dutifully <br>
                Observe the transient state of each snowflake, for as <br>
                You turn your attention elsewhere, even if only for a <br>
                Brisk moment, it's gone, leaving behind only an  <br>
                Imprint of what was just there. <br>
                Gone is the color from the land, leaving only the <br>
                Dreary shades of white and gray that dot the landscape <br>
                And fuse into dots and smears of light and dark with the <br>
                Yellow of warm, hospitable light breaking the sheet of <br>
                Tender, suffocating angst that filled the air. <br>
                My dear, fret not over the bleak frigid wild, but <br>
                Rest assured that the warmth of others will keep the light ablaze.<br>

                Words are not enough to explain to you <br>
                What blossoms deep within me<br>
                As your eyes stare deep into mine.<br>

                Words will not suffice to describe the feeling<br>
                Of a brisk breeze brushing past<br>
                Long, strands of hair fluttering,<br>
                Carefree, like floating on air.<br>
                <br>
                Words can not express the hope<br>
                That one day, perhaps we can be forever<br>
                Time intertwined two threads to one. <br>
                That one day, we will stay together<br>
                No matter the circumstances. No matter the strife.<br>
                <br>
                Words are not enough to explain to you.<br>
                So I drew a little picture<br>

                Violet sky. <br>
                The last rays of sun retreat behind the horizon,<br>
                and create a gradient, slowly retreating back<br>
                into the dark, abyssal zenith<br>
                <br>
                All of dusk's brilliance has long since faded<br>
                the hues of orange, purple and pink all <br>
                gone away, only the persistent blue remaining<br>
                and covering the entire sky in its dull glow.<br>
                <br>
                The glow of love, although it appears in passionate<br>
                colors, hues, and vivid flashes, in this muted form<br>
                should be held in no less esteem to its explosive counterpart,<br>
                the lustrous blue no less beautiful than the brilliant warm tone.<br>
                <br>
                Lie back, and let your eyes drift from light to dark.<br>
                As the stars peep out, and start to shimmer from their inky veil.<br>
                And let your mind wander, find infinite possibilities and futures,<br>
                like the infinite worlds that exist beyond your gaze, into the universe.<br>
